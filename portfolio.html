                <p>Left this in for posterities sake. The first HTML project that I ever completed, as basic as they come.</p>

                <p>Still rudimentary, this HTML site is a tribute page for my cat Mo</p>

                <p>An exercise on the most basic HTML programming concepts.</p>

                <p>Now we're getting somewhere. A tongue-in-cheek tribute to a hypothetical Dark Lord of Cupcakes. Uses media settings to adapt to device size. HTML with CSS. The link goes to its GH Pages site.</p>

               <ul>
                 <li>Reed College Graduate ('14) with a BA in English Literature</li>
                 <li>Worked as a full-time editor for 2.5 years, focusing on journal publications written by ESL authors</li>
                 <li>Coding has grown from hobby to passion to career</li>
                 <li>A synthesis of problem-solving skills, education in the humanities, and expertise in coding make me uniquely equipped to add value from day one. A worker for our modern world.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Basketball</li>
                <p>4 years of varsity for the Reed College basketball team. This is a lot like having the highest GPA on the UF Gators' offensive line. It's a great accomplishment but doesn't prove much.</p>
                <li>Running</li>
                <p>Keeps me energized and moving. Getting back into the habit of entering organized 5Ks.</p>
                <li>Magic the Gathering</li>
                <p>Mostly for fun but I've had some minor competitive success leading to moderate cash prizes (~$750 so far in 2017).</p>
                <li>Reading</li>
                <p>Recovering literature addict. If missing can be found in an armchair with a good book.</p>
                <li>Video Games</li>
                <p>Took a long break. Dabble in Hearthstone, Fallout 4, Witcher 3, and Ocarina of Time.</p>
